                                                HACKERRANK SOLUTION
I post my solutions to the problems on Hackerrank.com in Python 3. I will keep this repository updated as I solve more problems.

Points to be noted :
-While using my solutions for solving Hackerrank problems always remove the text between input()
-While adding files to the repository make put the logic code into a function
-The solutions added must clear all the test cases at Hackerrank.com
